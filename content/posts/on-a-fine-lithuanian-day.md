On a fine Lithuanian day in 2006, I got a surprise. Working at the American Center in Old Town Vilnius, a city full of the ghosts of history, I was pleased to have one of the best jobs in the whole of the Foreign Service. As a public affairs officer and cultural attaché, it was a relief to work in a place where almost everyone openly liked Americans. In a world full of unhappy misperception, I faced just the exact opposite in Vilnius: here instead I had to manage expectations of what we were actually capable of doing. We were not just a benign new Western version of the Warsaw Pact after all. So it was in my daily routine to meet a stream of enthusiastic petitioners—young, old, academics, activists, parading in with bright new ideas of big things that we could do together. Seminars, art exhibitions, music recitals, film festivals; you get the picture. In other words, I was thoroughly used to people asking me for things.

I met photographer Saulius Paukštys when I first came to Vilnius. He had lent our Center an exhibit of his photographs of Vilnius city, all shot from a hot air balloon. By this time in 2006, before the great global recession, Vilnius was flush with energy, creativity, and optimism, having finally hit its stride as a free and proud European capital. Modernity was rampant, but in good architectural taste, as everyone well-knew that what often fascinated not just tourists but also investors, was the seeming unspoiled beauty of what some called “an undiscovered Prague.” By no means did this imply that Vilnius had lived its long history as an untouched, untrodden backwater--just the exact opposite. In Lithuania one often hears its people boast that they lie at the geographic center of Europe. As a result, Vilnius was massively and historically trodden on over the centuries by waves of boots and tank treads, from the Teutonic Knights of the 14th century to occupation Soviet tanks in living memory of older siblings and parents of today’s millennial generation. The 20th century’s horrors fell hard on the peoples of Lithuania-Jewish, Polish, Lithuanian, and Roma—yet through it all managed to leave much of the city’s architectural legacy intact.
